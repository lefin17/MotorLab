- Now it become to work with laboratory stand which include axial pump, hydromotor and hydrocylinder.
- Feedback by resistance
- now try to make manual control of system.

2016-07-29 - Ideas
# UI (Android app) 
- BT settings for connetion between app & arduino
- Working area - changin Frequncy till width of Impulse width
- Impulse width - 
- Impulse Amplitude - 10 level from zero till full range (255)
- Stop button
- connection status
- adv area

# Arduino
constants:
- motor pin
- bluetooth module pins

vars: 
- period of impulse
- period of delay between impulse
- changing polarity
